- 👋 Hi, I’m @ald-p and I am on a journey of learning coding.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full-stack web developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I hope to continue learning frameworks and backend development in hopes of being able to create my own apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others on how I can improve my code through the projects in my Github.
